## ABOUT THE PROJECT

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
Welcome to the _GitHub repository_ of my **TO DO** project! Here you can find information about the project's development, such as which technologies were used, how to install and run the project, usage and more.

</p>
</div>

This site provides a simple TO DO for you and was developed to study about manipulate dates in React and serve as an extension of my LinkedIn. Users will find the following feature: **Write a todo, mark as complete and delete a todo**.
